This repo integrates with Piper TTS (https://github.com/rhasspy/piper)
I don't want credit for their incredible repo

I used the cori medium voice but you can just change that by tweaking the tts file and adding the .onnx and .onnx.json files for your preferred one.

This isn't really meant to be a crazy project. I just made it real quick for convenience and made it public to share with friends easily.
